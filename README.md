# Generative AI: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
Guest lecture on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for DS 3891 Generative AI 

## Intro

RAG was first introduced in Meta's 2020 paper titled ["Retrieval Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401) Since then, it has become a widely popular method to enhance generative AI reponses. This method relies on giving a corpus of information to a large language model (LLM), which then uses that information to generate its response.
RAG is best for situations in which LLM users want fact-based answers or answers with sources from a specific collection.

## Using this Repo

Use this repo to access a tutorial notebook on implementing RAG using the Python library Langchain.
